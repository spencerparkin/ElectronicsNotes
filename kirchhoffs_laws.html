        <h1>Kirchoff's Laws</h1>
        <p>
            Kirchoff gives us two fundamental laws of electronic circuits.  They are as follows.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The amount of current flowing into any point is the same as the amount of current flowing out of that point.</li>
            <li>The net change in voltage from a point, around the circuit, and back to that point, is always zero.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Further explanation of these laws will reveal itself in our application of these laws.  For now, these
            laws can be explained based on our intuitive model of electronic circuits.  If you think about a marble
            at a point on a track traveling from that point to the bottom of the elevator, taking the elevator back up,
            and then going back down to the same point again, then you'll see that through this experience, the
            net change in height for the marble is zero.  Similarly, no two marbles can occupy the same point on
            a track, so while marbles flow into that point, marbles must also flow out of it.  Such a point may
            exist at a junction--a place where the track splits or converges or both.
