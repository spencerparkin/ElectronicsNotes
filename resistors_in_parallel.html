        <h1>Resistors in Parallel</h1>
        <p>
            Referring to the following circuit diagram...
        </p>

        <p>
            ...we let \(\{R_i\}_{i=1}^N\) be a set of \(N\) resistors in parallel, and let \(V_{bat}\)
            denote the total voltage of the battery.  These are our known values.  Unknown will be the
            values in \(\{V_i\}_{i=1}^N\), the voltage drops across each resistor, \(\{I_i\}_{i=1}^N\),
            the currents running through each resistor, \(R_{eqv}\), the equivalent resistance of
            all the resistors, and \(I\), the net current flowing through the circuit.  Note that the
            battery has been split apart to make the digram simpler.

            Our first observation here is an application of Kirchhoff's first law.  Being made,
            we realize that for all \(i\in[1,N]\), we have \(V_{bat}=V_i\).  Why?  Because no matter
            which path we take through the circuit, each resistor's voltage drop is paired with the entire voltage
            gain of the battery.

            Applying Kirchhoff's second law, we get the equation \(I=\sum_{i=1}^N I_i\).  This can be seen
            while examining the junctions before and after the resistors.  Combining this with Ohm's law,
            we find that...
            $$ V_{bat} = R_{eqv}I = R_{eqv}\sum_{i=1}^N I_i = R_{eqv}\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{V_{bat}}{R_i}. $$
            Clearly, \(V_{bat}\) cancels on both sides, leaving us, after a bit of rearrangement, with...
            $$ \frac{1}{R_{eqv}} = \sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{R_i} $$
            ...an elegant complement to the formula we get for resisters in series.
            It's worth noting that for all \(i\in[1,N]\), we have \(R_{eqv}\leq R_i\).
