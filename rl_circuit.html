        <h1>RL Circuit</h1>
        <p>
            The LR circuit is fundamental to the understanding of inductors.  It is as follows.

        <h2>The Inductors Spinning Up</h2>
        <p>
            We have here a battery supplying voltage \(V_{bat}\), a resistor of resistance \(R\),
            and an inductor of inductance \(L\).  These are our constants.  Interestingly, however,
            the voltage across the inductor and resistor will change over time.  Their sum, of course,
            will always be \(V_{bat}\) according to Kirchhoff's voltage law.  Initially, the voltage
            across the resistor will be zero while that of the inductor will be \(V_{bat}\), over
            time the tables will turn, then finally, these will swap.  We want to know how this happens
            over time.  The first two equations we need are immediate from our study of Ohm's Law
            and Kirchhoff's Laws.  Namely,
            $$
            \begin{align}
            V_R(t) &= RI(t), \\
            V_{bat} &= V_L(t) + V_R(t).
            \end{align}
            $$
            We now recall the relationship between the inductance \(L\), the change in current,
            and the voltage across the inductor.
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}I(t) = \frac{V_L(t)}{L}
            $$
            Putting everything together, it is not hard to arrive at...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}V_L(t) = -\frac{R}{L}V_L(t).
            $$
            With initial condition \(V_L(0)=V_{bat}\), this easily solves as...
            $$
            V_L(t) = V_{bat}e^{-Rt/L}.
            $$
            Solving for \(I(t)\), we get...
            $$
            I(t) = \frac{V_{bat}}{R}(1-e^{-Rt/L}).
            $$
            Notice how the current begins at zero, then rises to \(V_{bat}/R\).

        <h2>The Inductor Winding Down</h2>
        <p>
            I suppose we could do all the math here, but if I understand correctly,
            only a theoretically perfect inductor would behave the way we would hope here.
            In practice, it's not the case.  I'll have to do some experiments.
