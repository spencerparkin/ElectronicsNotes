            An interesting observation about resistors is that their voltage drops can
            change, but this isn't the case with LEDs.  LEDs will always eat the same amount
            of voltage.  If we consider a circuit that contains just a battery, resistor, and
            an LED, then the voltage across the resistor will grow or shrink to satisfy
            the equation \(V_{bat} = V_{R} + V_{led}\).
        </p>
        <p>
            So what happens if we take out the resistor?  Well, I suppose this forces the LED
            to absorb all the voltage, which will more than likely burn it out.

        <p>
            So the resistor helps us protect how much voltage we send through the LED, because
            it absorbs the remainder of battery voltage.  But we also have to protect the LED from
            how much current it will have to handle.  How do we choose an appropriate resistor?
            Let \(P_{max}\) be the max power the LED can handle.  Then we need \(P_{max}\geq IV_{led}\), where \(I=V_{bat}/R\).
            Combining these, we find that...
            $$
            R\geq\frac{V_{bat}V_{led}}{P_{max}}.
            $$
            It would be interesting if we could calculate the minimum value of \(R\) to make the LED go dark.
        </p>

            Note that LEDs are diodes, so they only allow current in one direction.  Diodes probably
            deserve their own treatment altogether.
