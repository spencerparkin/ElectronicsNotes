            An interesting observation about resistors is that their voltage drops can
            change, but this isn't the case with LEDs.  LEDs will always eat the same amount
            of voltage.  If we consider a circuit that contains just a battery, resistor, and
            an LED, then the voltage across the resistor will grow or shrink to satisfy
            the equation \(V_{bat} = V_{R} + V_{led}\).  In other words, changing the voltage
            across the battery or the LED requires us to change out those components, but no such
            change is required to change the voltage across the resistor.
        </p>

            So what happens if we take out the resistor?  Well, I suppose this forces the LED
            to absorb all the voltage, which will more than likely burn it out.

            So the resistor helps us protect how much voltage we send through the LED, because
            it absorbs the remainder of battery voltage.  But we also have to protect the LED from
            how much current it will have to handle.  How do we choose an appropriate resistor?
            Let \(P_{max}\) be the max power the LED can handle.  Then we need \(P_{max}\geq IV_{led}\), where \(I=V_{bat}/R\),
            which approximates the resistence of the LED to be zero.
            Combining these, we find that...
            $$
            R\geq\frac{V_{bat}V_{led}}{P_{max}}.
            $$
            It would be interesting if we could calculate the minimum value of \(R\) to make the LED go dark.
            This is probably a function of \(P_{min}\), the minimum power requirement of the LED.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that LEDs are diodes, so they only allow current in one direction.  Diodes probably
            deserve their own treatment altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, we would want to protect the resistor too from having to handle too much power.
            In that case, we only reduce the amount of voltage it's taking by reducing the voltage of the
            battery.
