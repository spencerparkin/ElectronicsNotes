        <h1>Ohm's Law</h1>
        <p>
            Here we reveal a fundamental relationship between voltage, current and resistance.
        </p>
        <h2>The Resistor</h2>
        <p>
            Associated with each resistor is a constant \(R\) denoting its resistance to current.
            (Variable resistors work by mechanically changing how far current has to travel
            through some sort of resistive channel.)
            Current through and voltage across a resistor may change over time, but their relationship
            is always governed by the equation...
            $$
            V = IR.
            $$
            This is <b>Ohm's Law</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that all electronic components exhibit some resistance, so this is applicable
            to all components to some extent.
        </p>
        <p>
            While on the subject, here we should discuss equivalents of Ohm's Law with respect
            to electronic components other than the resistor.
        </p>
        <h2>The Capacitor</h2>
        <p>
            Associated with each capacitor is a constant \(C\) denoting its capacitance.
            (Interestingly, this is purely a geometric property of the capacitor plates
            in terms of surface area, how far apart they are, how much they overlap, etc.  Variable
            capacitors probably operate by mechanically changing the overlap.)
            The charge \(Q\) on a capacitor and the voltage \(V_C\) across the capacitor can change
            over time, but their relationship is always governed by the equation...
            $$
            Q(t) = CV_C(t).
            $$
            But to get something analogous to Ohm's Law, we need to relate voltage and current
            with respect to the capacitor.  Letting \(I\) be functions of time \(t\),
            we need to add the equation...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}Q(t) = \pm I(t),
            $$
            ...but what is this saying?  Well, capacitors can charge and discharge over time,
            and they do that when we pass a current through them using a battery, or let a current
            flow from them, respectively.  What the equation says is that the rate of change of charge
            in the capacitor is directly proportional to the current flowing through/from it.  This makes
            sense, because we can imaging electron build-up on the plates as current flows through
            the capacitor, or electron depletion as current flows from the capacitor.  I'm not yet sure,
            however, how to describe the difference between charge and voltage in physical terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            So Ohm's Law of capacitors, if you will, is given by...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}V_C(t) = \pm\frac{I(t)}{C}.
            $$
        </p>
        <h2>The Inductor</h2>
        <p>
            Associated with each inductor is a constant \(L\) denoting its inductance.
            Interestingly, I think the function of this component derives purely from its geometric properties as well.
            Specifically, a winding current creates an electromagnetic field, and a changing electromagnetic field
            induces a current.  In this case, a current in the opposite direction of the current
            we're trying to pass through the inductor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Admittedly, all of the real physics behind this is
            way too hard for me to comprehend.  My intuition about inductors is based on the idea of a fly-wheel.
            A constant force (voltage) applied to them will slowly build momentum in the fly-wheel.
            The applied force diminishes as the wheel gains momentum (because current is able to flow more and more)
            until only a minimum force is needed to have the fly-wheel maintain that momentum.
            When the force is removed altogether, the inductor becomes a source of energy
            (voltage) until the momentum dissipates.  Unlike a capacitor, however, too much of this
            energy is lost through means other than the inducement of a current, such as heat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ohm's Law of inductors, if you will, is given by...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}I(t) = \pm\frac{V_L(t)}{L}.
            $$
            So the rate of change of current is proportional to the voltage across the inductor, and
            inversely proportional to its inductance.  Notice what a nice complement this is to Ohm's
            Law for capacitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be more interesting, however, if we could derive this equation using a model
            that involves the electromagnetic field.  If I had to guess, I'd let \(E(t)\) denote
            the energy in the electromagnetic field at time \(t\).  Then I would say...
            $$
            E(t) = LI(t),
            $$
            ...which is to say that this energy is directly proportional to the inductance of the
            inductor and the amount of current flowing through it.  Then...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}E(t) = \pm V_L(t),
            $$
            ...which is to say that the rate of change of that energy is proportional to the amount
            of voltage across the inductor.  Notice how these, together, gives us Ohm's Law for
            inductors, as contrived as they may be.
