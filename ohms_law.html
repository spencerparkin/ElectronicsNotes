        <h1>Ohm's Law</h1>
        <p>
            Here we reveal a fundamental relationship between voltage, current and resistance.
        </p>
        <h2>The Resistor</h2>
        <p>
            Associated with each resistor is a constant \(R\) denoting its resistance to current.
            (Variable resistors work by mechanically changing how far current has to travel
            through some sort of resistive channel.)
            Current through and voltage across a resistor may change over time, but their relationship
            is always governed by the equation...
            $$
            V = IR.
            $$
            This is <b>Ohm's Law</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that all electronic components exhibit some resistance, so this is applicable
            to all components to some extent.
        </p>
        <p>
            While on the subject, here we should discuss equivalents of Ohm's Law with respect
            to electronic components other than the resistor.
        </p>
        <h2>The Capacitor</h2>
        <p>
            Associated with each capacitor is a constant \(C\) denoting its capacitance.
            (Interestingly, this is purely a geometric property of the capacitor plates
            in terms of surface area, how far apart they are, how much they overlap, etc.  Variable
            capacitors probably operate by mechanically changing the overlap.)
            The charge \(Q\) on a capacitor and the voltage \(V\) across the capacitor can change
            over time, but their relationship is always governed by the equation...
            $$
            Q = CV.
            $$
            But to get something analogous to Ohm's Law, we need to relate voltage and current
            with respect to the capacitor.  Letting \(I\) and \(Q\) be functions of time \(t\),
            we need to add the equation...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}Q(t) = \pm I(t),
            $$
            ...but what is this saying?  Well, capacitors can charge and discharge over time,
            and they do that when we pass a current through them using a battery, or let a current
            flow from them, respectively.  What the equation says is that the rate of change of charge
            in the capacitor is directly proportional to the current flowing through/from it.  This makes
            sense, because we can imaging electron build-up on the plates as current flows through
            the capacitor, or electron depletion as current flows from the capacitor.  I'm not yet sure,
            however, how to describe the difference between charge and voltage in physical terms.
