        <h1>Analyzing Circuits of Resistors and Batteries</h1>
        <p>
            Circuit analysis in general is difficult, because not all components have exactly 2 leads,
			and not all components are static; rather, some behave dynamically.
			That is, in the general case, current and
			voltage measurements across the circuit can very over time.  (Note that the term "circuit" is
			used loosely.  Strictly speaking, a circuit is just one loop, but we use the term to mean a
			graph of electrical components.)  Consequently, a circuit may have multiple steady-states,
			or no steady-state at all as things fluctuate over time, oscillate, or perhaps some combination
			of all such behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here, however, we're going to consider the case of circuits consisting of just resistors
			and batteries.  In all such cases, there is just one steady state.  This state can be described
			as the current and voltage levels measurable at every point in the circuit.  Being steady,
			each such point measures a constant value for each of these two attributes.  Our goal will be,
			given a circuit under the constraints thus named, what are the current and voltage levels at
			each principle point in the circuit?
        </p>
		<p>
			Recall that voltage is a measure of difference in charge between two points in a circuit.
			So voltage at a point in a circuit refers to the difference in charge between that point
			and wherever ground can be found in the circuit.
		</p>
		<p>
			What we find is that performing this analysis all just boils down to solving a linear
			system of equations after applying Ohm's Law and Kirkoff's votlage and current laws.  And that's
			all there is to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the steps that I believe are required.
			<ol>
				<li>Identify all unknown current and voltage values across the circuit, remembering that
				current changes only at junctions, while voltages change only across components.</li>
				<li>We now need at least as many equations are there are unknowns, and no equation can be
				a linear combination of any other equation.
					<ol>
						<li>Follow cycles of the circuit graph around while applying Kirkoff's voltage law to relate voltages to voltages.</li>
						<li>Examine junctions of the circuit graph while applying Kirkoff's current law to relate currents to currents.</li>
						<li>Use Ohm's Law to relate currents to voltages.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Solve the linear system of equations.  Plug and chug, or use linear algebra.
			</ol>
			Note that the direction of current flow is perhaps the trickiest part, and is required for a
			correct application of Kirkoff's current law.  I suppose a graph traversal algorithm could determine
			current directions using a breadth-first-search from a battery.  (There could be more than one
			battery in a circuit.  There is typically only one.)  In some cases, you may need to guess
			the direction of current, then if you're wrong, you're only wrong up to sign.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another thing to keep in mind when considering the direction of current flow is simply that of
			voltage level above ground.  Current is trying to flow from high voltage to low voltage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember that while the currents of two parallel paths (that split apart and join back together)
			may differ, their voltage drops are the same.  Conversley, two paths in series share the same
			current reading, but their voltage drops may differ.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only examples and practice will make this written description come into focus.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's worth noting too that there is a recursive method for analyzing such circuits that is
			based on an understanding that networks of resistors act like a single resistor of a singular value.
			This understanding, along with a knowledge of how resistors combine in parallel and series, can
			sometimes be enough to fully analyze the kind of circutis we're talking about here, but not always.
