        <h1>Capacitors in Series and Parallel</h1>
		<p>
		In both cases, suppose a battery, a resistor, and then a network
		of capacitors are our circuit.  Let the battery have constant voltage \(V_{bat}\), and
		the capacitors each have voltage \(V_i\), current \(I_i\), and capacitance \(C_i\).  We'll be
		interested to find \(C_{eqv}\).
		</p>
		<h2>The Series Case</h2>
		<p>
		In this case, we have, for all \(i\), \(I=I_i\), and we have \(V_{eqv}=\sum_i V_i\),
		since \(V_{bat}=V_R+V_{eqv}\) and \(V_{bat}=V_R+\sum_i V_i\).
		We now recall that...
		$$
		\frac{d}{dt}V_{eqv} = \frac{I}{C_{eqv}},
		$$
		...and similarly...
		$$
		\frac{d}{dt}V_i = \frac{I_i}{C_i}.
		$$
		We then write...
		$$
		\frac{I}{C_{eqv}}=\frac{d}{dt}V_{eqv}=\frac{d}{dt}\sum_iV_i = \sum_i\frac{d}{dt}V_i=\sum_i\frac{I_i}{C_i}=I\sum_i\frac{1}{C_i}.
		$$
		Now since \(I\neq 0\) for all \(t\), we can divide through by it to get our result...
		$$
		\frac{1}{C_{eqv}}=\sum_i\frac{1}{C_i}.
		$$
		<h2>The Parallel Case</h2>
		<p>
		In this case, we have, for all \(i\), \(V_{eqv}=V_i\), since \(V_{bat}=V_R+V_{eqv}\)
		and \(V_{bat}=V_R+V_i\).  And we have \(I=\sum_i I_i\).
		Recalling our relationships between current and voltage for each capacitor and the equivilant
		capacitor, we then write...
		$$
		\frac{d}{dt}V_{eqv}=\frac{I}{C_{eqv}}=\frac{1}{C_{eqv}}\sum_iI_i=\frac{1}{C_{eqv}}\sum_iC_i\frac{d}{dt}V_i.
		$$
		Using \(V_i=V_{eqv}\), this can be rearranged as...
		$$
		\left(1-\frac{1}{C_{eqv}}\sum_i C_i\right)\frac{d}{dt}V_{eqv}=0.
		$$
		But again, \(I\neq 0\) for all \(t\), so we get our result...
		$$
		C_{eqv}=\sum_i C_i.
		$$
