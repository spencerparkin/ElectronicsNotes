        <h1>A Case of Zero Current</h1>
        <p>
            Consider the following circuit of resistors, all of which are of value \(R\).
        </p>

        <p>
            Interestingly, from our model of electric current (as marbles on tracks), it is
            immediately clear that there is no current from junction \(B\) to \(C\) or vice-versa.
            In fact, as pointed out by Mark, by symmetry, it is contradictory to claim a direction of current flow between
            either of these two points.  Anyhow, here we're going to show mathematically that
            \(I_{BC}=0\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that in our notation, \(V_{AB}=V_{A} - V_{B}\), meaning the voltage
            across \(A\)-to-\(B\) is the voltage \(V_{A}\) at \(A\) differing from that \(V_{B}\)
            at \(B\).
        </p>
        <p>
            Examining junction \(C\), Kirchhoff tells us that \(I_{AC}+I_{BC}=I_{CD}\).
            Likewise, examining junction \(B\), we find that \(I_{AB}=I_{BC}+I_{BD}\).
            Now see that...
            $$
            \begin{align}
            I_{BC} &= I_{CD} - I_{AC} \\
             &= V_{CD}/R - V_{AC}/R \\
             &= (V_{CD} - V_{AC})/R \\
             &= (V_C - V_D - V_A + V_C)/R \\
             &= (2V_C - V_{bat})/R,
            \end{align}
            $$
            ...since \(V_A=V_{bat}\) and \(V_D=0\).  We now write...
            $$
            \begin{align}
            RI_{AC} + RI_{BC} &= RI_{CD} \\
            V_A - V_C + V_B - V_C &= V_C - V_D \\
            V_B &= 3V_C - V_{bat},
            \end{align}
            $$
            ...and we write...
            $$
            \begin{align}
            RI_{AB} &= RI_{BC} + RI_{BD} \\
            V_A - V_B &= V_B - V_C + V_B - V_D \\
            V_C &= 3V_B - V_{bat}.
            \end{align}
            $$
            Combining these last two equations, we find that \(V_C = V_{bat}/2\) which,
            when plugged into our earlier equation for \(I_{BC}\), gives us the desired result.

            Note that in general, finding the equivilant resistance of a sub-network of resistors
            will all boil down in the end to solving a system of linear equations.  The task involves
            the application of Kirchhoff's Laws.  Not all sub-networks can be tackled using what we
            know of resistors in series and parallel alone.
