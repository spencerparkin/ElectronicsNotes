        <h1>The Physics & Analogous Models</h1>
        <p>
            Circuits involving nothing more than batteries and resistors are fundamental
            to the study of electronics, because we need a power source, all electronic
            components have some internal resistance (or the opposite), and we must study
            steady-state (or static) electrical systems before we get into dynamical systems.
        </p>
        <h2>Reality</h2>
        <p>
            My understanding is that atoms are made of electrons and protons, and they
            like to have an equal number of each.  Atoms with an excess of electrons (i.e.,
            more electrons than protons) want to get rid of some while those with a deficit
            (i.e., less electrons than protons) want to gain some.  The exchange of electrons
            from one atom to another to appease these demands constitutes what we call
            electric current.
        </p>
        <p>
            Atoms of various kinds are more or less willing to give up or gain electrons.
            Those more willing are conductors of electric current, and those less are insulators.
        </p>
        <p>
            An atom with more electrons than protons is said to be negatively charged,
            while an atom with less electrons than protons is said to be negatively charged.
            A source of electrical energy (e.g., a battery) provides positive and negative
            terminals at which can be found atoms of the same charge.  When a conductive path
            is completed from one terminal to another, current can and does want to flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the laws of physics is that energy is neither created nor destroyed.
            The electrical energy from the battery is converted to other forms of energy
            by the components in an electrical circuit, such as light, heat and sound.
        </p>
        <h2>Intuition</h2>
        <p>
            A useful model/analogy<sup>1</sup> of electron flow in a circuit is to think of marbles and tracks.
            A battery is like an elevator that continuously takes marbles up to the top and dumps
            them down a track.  The pathways of the circuit are tracks the marbles can roll down.
            These tracks split and converge as the circuit diagram dictates until they eventually
            arrive at the bottom of the elevator.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Voltage</b> at a point on a track in the circuit may be thought of as the height of that point
            above ground level.  <b>Current</b> at a point may be thought of as the number of marbles (electrons)
            per second passing that point.  <b>Resistance</b> may be thought of as the frictional properties
            of the track.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that voltage across two points is the difference in height between those two points.
        </p>
        <h2>Direction of Current Flow</h2>
        <p>
            A fundamental question of any circuit is that of which way current is flowing at
            any particular point.
            (Never-mind how much current is flowing for now.)  The answer comes from our model of
            electronic circuits, and it is as simple as that current flows from places of
            high voltage to places of lower voltage.  As far as how much, it suffices to say at
            this point that electrons are lazy.  Most prefer the path of least resistance.  Few
            are willing to take harder paths.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a bit distressing (or was for me) to learn that circuit diagrams are drawn and circuit analyses
            are performed using a convention of current flowing in the opposite direction from that
            of reality.  In reality, current flows from the negative terminal of the battery to the
            positive.  Conventionally, current flows from the positive terminal to the negative.
            What you must quickly learn is that in our analysis of some circuits, it almost doesn't matter.
            The symmetry of many circuit problems and components may be an explanation.  Anyhow, I'm still weary
            of conventional current, and cannot yet see at this point how it won't matter for more
            complicated circuits containing more complicated types of components.
