        <h1>RC Circuit</h1>
        <p>
            The RC circuit is fundamental to the understanding of capacitors.  It is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Insert circuit diagram here.
        </p>
        <h2>Charging the Capacitor</h2>
        <p>
            We have here a battery supplying voltage \(V_{bat}\), a resistor of resistance \(R\),
            and a capacitor of capacitance \(C\).  (What exactly is capacitance?  Define it.)
            These are our constants.  Interestingly, however, the voltages across the capacitor
            and resistor will change over time.  Their sum, of course, will always be \(V_{bat}\)
            according to Kirchhoff's voltage law.  Initially, the voltage across the resistor
            will be \(V_{bat}\) while that of the capacitor will be zero, then finally, these
            will swap.  We want to know how this happens over time.  The first two equations
            we need are immediate from our study of Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws.
            $$
            \begin{align}
            V_R(t) &= RI(t) \\
            V_{bat} &= V_C(t) + V_R(t)
            \end{align}
            $$
            Now let \(q(t)\) denote the charge of the capacitor at time \(t\).
            (What units is this in?  What does it mean?  Is it a measure of the difference
            of electron excess or deficit between the plates of the capacitor?)
            We then have...
            $$
            V_C(t) = \frac{q(t)}{C}.
            $$
            ...but I do not yet know where this comes from.  Note that it is an equation
            akin to Ohm's Law for resistors, especially when combined with the next
            equation.  (It's someone's law for capacitors, I suppose.)
            $$
            I(t) = \frac{d}{dt}q(t)
            $$
            Who figured this out?  Where does it come from?  I wish I knew.  Until then,
            it says that the current at time \(t\) is the rate of change of the charge
            of the capacitor at time \(t\).  Who knew?!
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow, we now have enough information to find a differential equation for
            the rate of change of the voltage of the capacitor.  Plugging all the equations
            into each other, it is not hard to arrive at...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}V_c(t) = \frac{V_{bat} - V_C(t)}{RC},
            $$
            ...which is actually quite intuitive.  The rate of change of the voltage
            of the capacitor is directly proportional to its distance from the battery voltage,
            and inversly proportional to the resistance \(R\) and capacitance \(C\).
            (I almost wrote down this very equation when I took at guess at what it should be.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow, it is a 1st-order linear differential equation, and one that is not terribly
            easy to solve.  You must use an integration factor.  Skipping those details, one can
            verify that the following is a solution to the DE, if our initial condition is \(V_C(0)=0\).
            $$
            V_C(t) = V_{bat}(1 - e^{-t/RC})
            $$
            With this equation, we can now calculate how much time it takes to charge the capacitor
            to within a given percentage of the battery's voltage.
        </p>
        <h2>Discharging the Capacitor</h2>
        <p>
            Throwing the switch in the circuit diagram above, we now have a circuit involving
            just the resistor and the capacitor.  With the battery removed, the only equation
            that changes is the one derived from Kirchhoff's voltage law.  We now have...
            $$
            V_C(t) + V_R(t) = 0.
            $$
            We then arrive at the DE...
            $$
            \frac{d}{dt}V_C(t) = \frac{-1}{RC}V_C(t),
            $$
            ...witch an initial condition of \(V_C(0)=V_{bat}\), if we let the capicotor fully charge.
            This is much easier to solve, and is simply...
            $$
            V_C(t) = V_{bat}e^{-t/RC}.
            $$
            We can now use this to calculate how much time it takes for the capacitor to discharge.
