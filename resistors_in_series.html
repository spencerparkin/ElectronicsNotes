    <h1>Resistors in Series</h1>
    <p>
        Refering to the following circuit diagram...
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/resistors_in_series.png"></center>
    <p>
        ...we let \(\{R_i\}_{i=1}^N\) be a set of \(N\) resistors in series, and
        let \(V_{bat}\) denote the total voltage of the battery.  These are our known values.
        Unknown will be the values in \(\{V_i\}_{i=1}^N\), the voltage drops across each
        resistor, \(\{I_i\}_{i=1}^N\), the currents running through each resistor, \(R_{eqv}\),
        the equivalent resistance of all the resistors, and \(I\), the net current flowing through the simple circuit.
        Note that the battery has been split apart to make the diagram simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our first observation here is an application of Kirchhoff's second law.  Being made, we realize
        that for all \(i\in[1,N]\), we have \(I=I_i\).  Why?  Because there is just one path through
        the entire circuit, and currents change only when paths split or converge.  That's the nature of current.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applying Ohm's law, we can now find that \(V_i=IR_i=V_{bat}R_i/R_{eqv}\), leaving \(R_{eqv}\) as all we yet need to deduce
        to determine all the voltage drops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the equation \(V_{bat}=IR_{eqv}\) and the set of equations
        \(\{V_i=I_iR_i\}_{i=1}^N\), we get...
        $$ IR_{eqv} = V_{bat}=\sum_{i=1}^N V_i = \sum_{i=1}^N IR_i = I\sum_{i=1}^N R_i. $$
        Now canceling \(I\) on both sides gives us our main result; namely,
        $$ R_{eqv} = \sum_{i=1}^N R_i. $$
    </p>
    <p>
        The major take-home point here is that the equivilant resistence of resistors in series is
        simply the sum of all the resistances of the resistors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that if I were using variables representing voltages at points instead of voltages across
        resistors, then we would have witnessed a telescoping sum in the math.
